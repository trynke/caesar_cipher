# User's Manual

## Purpose
This program implements the Caesar cipher. In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Starting
```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/trynke/caesar_cipher.git
# start the project
$ python caesar_cipher.py
# the program works in console
```

## Performing basic functions
The main functions are ***encryption*** and ***decryption***. You only need to choose the mode by typing a corresponding integer, following the instructions of the program. Then you type your text and - voila, the job is done.

## End of the work
Type number 3 in console to exit the program.
